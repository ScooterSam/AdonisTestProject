# AdonisJs Application

##What is it?
This is a very simple todo application built in AdonisJS and Angular 1.6. Its using web sockets to communicate between client/server. I built this just to try out something new.

##How to run?
1. You need to have followed all the instructions from AdonisJS for setting up applications. I'm not going to explain that here.
2. Run `node ace migration:run` to migrate all of the tables
3. You're good to go
